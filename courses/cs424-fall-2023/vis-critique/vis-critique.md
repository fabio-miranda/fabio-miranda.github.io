### Visualization Critique

In this assignment, you will need to select a visualization that you think is particularly interesting and critique it, considering what we have seen in class.

First, you should find a visualization that you think is **interesting and complex enough** that you can effectively critique it. This visualization should be interactive, i.e., the user must be able to change the content of the visualization through interactions.

Here are a few places to look for interesting visualizations, but feel free to go beyond those:

* [FlowingData](https://flowingdata.com/)
* [The New York Times](https://nyt.com)
* [Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/)
* [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/)

Once you have selected a visualization, please add it to the spreadsheet shared on Piazza. **Each team must select a unique visualization** (i.e., no two teams can select the same visualization), so make sure no other team has already selected your proposed visualization.

Based on what we have seen in class, you should critically evaluate the visualization. Here are a few topics you can use to frame your evaluation:

* What is the purpose of the visualization?
* What is the dataset being used?
* What are the questions?
* What are the attributes of the data? How are they mapped to the questions?
* What are the encodings and channels? Are these the most appropriate choices?
* What works and what doesn't work?

A visualization can be innefective considering different aspects, such as [poor use of scaling](https://blog.datawrapper.de/dualaxis/), poor use of channels (check *Expressiveness types and effectiveness ranks* slide, or [here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2288400)). You can use the following general workflow to help in your critique:

1 - Identify the purpose of the visualization, and the insights it is trying to convey.
2 - Identify marks and channels, and what is potentially problematic with these choices.
3 - Discuss how to use more effective marks and channels for the previously identified purposes and insights.

#### Deliverables

Create a markdown document with your evaluation and submit it using GitHub (see Piazza for invitation link). The document should also contain a link to the visualization, as well as images from the visualization to clearly justify your evaluation. Use the previous topics to help you frame your visualization, but you are free to use other questions if you think they are needed to ground your evaluation.

#### Grading

Your submission will be graded according to your write up:
- Excellent (A): detailed writeup, grounded justifications for your evaluation.
- Good (B): good justifications, could be more detailed.
- Poor (C): missing or incomplete justifications.
