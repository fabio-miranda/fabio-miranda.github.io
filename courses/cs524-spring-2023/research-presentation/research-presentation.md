### CS524 Big Data Visualization and Analytics - Research presentations


For the research presentations, you will first need to (1) select a recent research paper from a top journal or conference and (2) summarize its main contributions in a ~10-minute presentation. No two groups can present the same paper, so it is very important to select the paper you want to present as soon as possible. Once you select the paper, make sure to add it to the shared spreadsheet (see Piazza for link).

#### Paper selection

The first step is to select a research paper you are interested in. As highlighted in class, the paper should cover *at least* one aspect of **big data visual analytics**. You can start your search by going through the issues of [IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=2945), [Computer Graphics Forum](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14678659), [IEEE Transactions on Big Data](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6687317), their associated conferences (e.g., IEEE VIS, EuroVis), or similar venues. You should *not* select a survey for your presentation, or a paper that was published more than 5 years ago. These are journals that cover broad areas, not only visualization and visual analytics, so it is important to choose your paper carefully as to satisfy the requirements. Before you start working on your presentation, make sure to send me an email so that I can certify whether your paper satisfies the requirements.

#### Paper presentation

You should prepare a ~10-minute presentation covering the main points of the paper, such as (1) motivation, (2) related work, (3) contributions, (4) evaluation, (5) conclusion and future work. Your presentation will be graded based on how well you summarized both the topic and the contributions of the paper. Just like the previous presentations, your group will be randomly assigned to present on Tuesday or Thursday, but you are expected to attend both presentation days.
