### Visualization Critique

In this assignment, you will need to select a visualization that you think is particularly interesting and critique it, considering what we have seen in class.

First, you should find a visualization that you think is **interesting and complex enough** that you can effectively critique it. This visualization should be interactive, i.e., the user must be able to change the content of the visualization through interactions.

Here are a few places to look for interesting visualizations, but feel free to go beyond those:

* [FlowingData](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips/wrvz-psew)
* [The New York Times](https://ride.divvybikes.com/system-data)
* [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/)

Once you have selected a visualization, please add it to the spreadsheet shared on Piazza. **Each team must present a unique visualization** (i.e., no two teams can present the same visualization), so make sure no other team has already selected your proposed visualization.

Based on what we have seen in class, you should critically evaluate the visualization. Here are a few topics you can use to frame your evaluation:

* What is the purpose of the visualization?
* What is the dataset being used?
* What are the questions?
* What are the attributes of the data? How are they mapped to the questions?
* What are the encodings and channels? Are these the most appropriate choices?
* What works and what doesn't work?

You will have 5 minutes to present your findings in class. Make sure you use screenshots to back up your comments.
