### Assignment 0: Getting Started

The goal of this assignment is to get familiar with GitHub Classroom, form your project groups, and select a dataset to be used in this course. By the end of this assignment, you will be set up to work collaboratively with your colleagues throughout the semester.

We will use GitHub to manage the deliverable. You should create a repository for your team on GitHub Classroom (see Piazza for the invitation link). Check resources below for pointers regarding GitHub and Markdown documentation.

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Setting up GitHub Classroom

Accept the GitHub Classroom invitation link shared on Piazza. You should create a repository for your team on GitHub Classroom. Ensure all team members are added as collaborators to the repository.

#### Task 2: Forming Groups

Form a group of up to three students. Enter your group information, including names and emails of group members, in the shared spreadsheet (link provided on Piazza).

Note: If you encounter difficulties finding a group, post on Piazza to connect with other students who are also looking for team members.

#### Task 3: Selecting a Dataset

Review the dataset options suggested below. Discuss with your group and select a dataset that aligns with your interests and goals for the course. For this task, ensure that you are comfortable working with the dataset and have a clear understanding of its type and attributes. It is up to you to ensure that you (1) have access to the dataset, (2) are reasonably comfortable working with it, and (3) understand the filtering options available when downloading it. Some of these datasets are reasonably large, so you may need to filter or preprocess them to make them manageable for your analysis. After making your selection, record it in the shared spreadsheet (see Piazza for the link).

No two groups can select the same dataset. Dataset selection will be handled on a first come, first served basis. Check if your preferred dataset has already been claimed; if so, you will need to select a different one. Groups are also free to select datasets not listed below, but these must be approved by me before they can be finalized. If your group wishes to propose a new dataset, please send me an email with the dataset details for review. When choosing a dataset, take into account its size, attributes, and overall complexity to ensure it is appropriate for the scope of the course. Some of the datasets linked below are accessible only through API calls. It is your responsibility to evaluate whether you are prepared to handle the additional complexity they may introduce during the course.

Note: If two or more groups list the same dataset in the spreadsheet, all groups except the first to select the dataset will have points deducted for failing to check for conflicts beforehand. Spreadsheet edit timestamps will be used to determine the order of selection and ensure fairness in this process.

If all of the datasets have already been selected by other groups, you will need to find a new one. Search the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/), [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/), [Analyze Boston](https://data.boston.gov/), or other data portals for more datasets. I will need to review your selection.

#### Deliverables

By the deadline, ensure your group repository is set up and includes a README.md file with: (1) Group member names and emails, (2) the dataset your group selected, (3) a brief explanation (~250 words) of why your group selected this dataset. Confirm your group and dataset selection are recorded in the shared spreadsheet.

#### Grading

This assignment will be graded on completion:
- Excellent (A): All deliverables completed on time and fully meet requirements.
- Good (B): Minor issues, such as incomplete information in the repository or spreadsheet.
- Poor (C): Significant issues or missing components.
