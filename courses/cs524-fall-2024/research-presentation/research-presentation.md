### CS524 Big Data Visualization and Analytics - Research presentations


For the research presentations, you will first need to (1) select a recent research paper from a top journal or conference and (2) summarize its main contributions in a 30-minute presentation. No two groups can present the same paper, so it is very important to select the paper you want to present as soon as possible. Once you select the paper, make sure to add it to the shared spreadsheet (see Piazza for link).

#### Paper selection

The first step is to select a research paper you are interested in. As highlighted in class, the paper should cover *at least* one aspect of **big data visual analytics**. You can start your search by going through the issues of [IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=2945), [Computer Graphics Forum](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14678659), [IEEE Transactions on Big Data](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6687317), their associated conferences (e.g., IEEE VIS, EuroVis), or similar venues. You should *not* select a survey for your presentation, or a paper that was published more than 5 years ago. These are journals that cover broad areas, not only visualization and visual analytics, so it is important to choose your paper carefully as to satisfy the requirements. Before you start working on your presentation, I have to agree with your team's selection -- send me an email and make sure to give yourself ample time in case any adjustments need to be made.

#### Paper presentation

You should prepare a ~30-minute presentation covering the main points of the paper. It is up to your team to create an outline that does justice to the paper. Your presentation will be evaluated based on the following criteria: the quality and clarity of your slides, the thoroughness and accuracy of your summary of both the topic and the paper's contributions, and the overall engagement and delivery of your presentation. You are encouraged to incorporate live demonstrations in your presentation.
