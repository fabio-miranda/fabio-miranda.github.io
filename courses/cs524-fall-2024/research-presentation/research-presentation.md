### CS524 Big Data Visualization and Analytics - Research presentations


For the research presentations, you will first need to select **at least** one research paper from a top journal or conference. These will be the *core* papers forming the foundation of your presentation; however, you are also expected to rely on other papers to ensure a comprehensive coverage of the broader research topic. Then, you should prepare and deliver a 30-minute presentation that (1) gives an overview of the papers' topic and (2) covers the papers' contributions. No two groups can present the same core papers, so it is very important to select the papers you want to present as soon as possible. Once you select the core papers, please email me to confirm whether your selection is approved. After that, add the core papers to the shared spreadsheet (see Piazza for link). You only need to include in the spreadsheet the core papers that will form the main foundation of your presentation.

#### Paper selection

The first step is to select **at least** one research paper you are interested in. As highlighted in class, the paper should cover **at least** one aspect of **big data visual analytics**. You can start your search by going through the issues of [IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=2945), [Computer Graphics Forum](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14678659), [IEEE Transactions on Big Data](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6687317), their associated conferences (e.g., IEEE VIS, EuroVis), or similar venues. These are journals that cover broad areas, not only visualization and visual analytics, so it is important to choose your papers carefully as to satisfy the requirements. You should *not* select papers published more than 10 years ago or surveys as one of the core papers for your presentation. **However, it is entirely reasonable (and even expected) that you will need to cover surveys and older works to provide a comprehensive overview of the research topic.**

You should select **at least** one research paper as the core paper. Note, however, that there is no maximum limit on the number of papers you can choose. Your team should evaluate the topic and select an appropriate number of papers that adequately cover the subject and provide sufficient material for a 30-minute presentation -- this will be reflected in the evaluation.

**Before you start working on your presentation, I have to agree with your team's selection of core papers -- send me an email and make sure to give yourself ample time in case any adjustments need to be made. Please note that at this point I will only provide superficial feedback on the appropriateness of your choices. I will not assess whether your selections are sufficient to cover the research topic in both depth and breadth. However, your decisions will, of course, be reflected in your presentation and, consequently, in your evaluation.**

#### Paper presentation

You should prepare a 30-minute presentation (+5 minutes for questions) covering the topic and the selected papers. Your team is responsible for creating an outline that does justice to the papers. Keep in mind that crafting a well-thought-out and organized presentation requires time and effort, and this will be carefully considered in your evaluation. Your presentation will be evaluated based on the following criteria: the quality and clarity of your slides, the organization of your presentation, the thoroughness and accuracy of your summary of both the topic and the papers' contributions, and the overall engagement and delivery of your presentation. You are encouraged to incorporate live demonstrations in your presentation.

Please keep in mind that you have 30 minutes for your presentation (+5 minutes for questions). This means you must carefully balance depth and breadth to stay within the allotted time without going over or under. You should ensure that your presentation is thorough enough to cover key points, which your team is responsible for accurately identifying, yet concise enough to stay within the allotted time. Avoid delving too deeply into any single point at the expense of others, but also be wary of covering too much material superficially. Proper time management is crucial and will be reflected in your evaluation. Consider rehearsing your presentation to ensure it fits within the time frame; a well-timed and rehearsed presentation should last 30 minutes (not 25 or 35).
