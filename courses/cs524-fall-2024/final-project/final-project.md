### General Information

The goal of the final project is to get you familiar with the main components of big data visual analytics systems. You will need to demonstrate your research skills by combining visualization, analytics, data mining, data structures and algorithms that work in tandem to enable interactive data exploration. There will be three milestones for this project spread throughout the semester: [project proposal](#milestone-1-project-proposal), [midterm review](#milestone-2-midterm-review), and [final presentation and report](#milestone-3-final-report-and-presentation).

We will use GitHub to manage code and documentation. You should create a repository for your team on GitHub Classroom (see Piazza for invitation link), and include **all** deliverables throughout the semester.


### Submission of Deliverables
You are expected to submit your deliverables using GitHub. You should create a repository for your team on GitHub Classroom (see Piazza for invitation link). Make sure you organize the different deliverables, including code, in different folders. **The GitHub project should contain a well-written description of the project.**

### Milestone 1: Project Proposal

The first milestone for the final project is proposing what you and your team will work on. You should start by brainstorming ideas with your teammate, and then reaching out for feedback.

#### M1 Objectives

In this milestone, you will:

1. Plan the research project you will be tackling during the semester.
2. Verify that all resources (including data) are in place to complete the project.
3. Motivate the problem and the potential contributions.

#### M1 Tentative Topics

There are several topics that cover visualization, analytics and data management of big data. You should frame your proposal in terms of how your contribution effectively tackles data problems from one (or more) of the angles covered in the course. For a concrete description of the types of contributions expected from a visualization researcher, read Lee et al.'s [Broadening Intellectual Diversity in Visualization Research Papers](https://cmci.colorado.edu/visualab/papers/19-CGA-ContributionTypes.pdf).

At the very least, you should articulate your proposal around one of the six visualization areas (defined [here](https://ieeevis.org/year/2022/info/call-participation/area-model#the-vis-area-model)), broadly reviewing limitations with current approaches and how your potential contributions will advance an area. Please refer to the course schedule for required readings that can give you a better idea for topics.

For a tentative list of topics, please see the ``final-project.pdf`` presentation shared on Piazza. I highly recommend you choose a topic (or dataset) that you are personally interested in and that you want to understand in more detail. Your team is responsible for surveying for interesting datasets and identifying challenges. Select a dataset that could present challenges to current methods while also creating opportunities for innovative ideas and approaches.

**Please be aware that merely creating a basic dashboard to visualize limited data is insufficient and does not meet the course expectations. Also be aware that the selection of a dataset is the most important step, as it will directly impact the rest of your project -- a simple dataset will not provide opportunities for new approaches. The selection of your dataset and the way you define your approach will be reflected in your evaluation.**

**Also, be proactive and plan to attend office hours to discuss ideas and papers that might be useful to your team, depending on your topic.**

#### M1 Deliverables

Your team should present the proposal, clearly explaining the problem (e.g., why it is important, how you plan to address it), covering prior work, describing the data, proposal and **timeline**. Each group presentation should last 12 minutes (+3 minutes for questions). Your group will be randomly assigned to present on Tuesday or Thursday, but you are expected to attend *both* presentation days. It is up to you and your teammates to decide how the presentation will be divided between each member of the team. Keep in mind that crafting a good presentation requires time and effort, and this will be carefully considered in your evaluation. Asking questions following teams' presentations will be used to assess class participation.

Your team is responsible for surveying for interesting datasets, identifying challenges, and crafting a well-thought-out and organized presentation. In this project proposal, you should **clearly** articulate how your proposal will tackle some of the problems related to the dataset, framing it around one of the areas of visualization research. Spend some time thinking and discussing potential challenges and solutions. Make sure that you are comfortable with the problem, dataset, and proposal. 

Proper time management is crucial and will be reflected in your evaluation. Consider rehearsing your presentation to ensure it fits within the time frame; a well-timed and rehearsed presentation should last 12 minutes (not 8 or 15).

### Milestone 2: Midterm Review

In the second milestone, you will present your proposal and intermediate results.

#### M2 Objectives

In this milestone, you will:

1. Summarize and present your proposal.
2. Organize and present your intermediate results.


#### M2 Deliverables

Your group should present the proposal and intermediate results. The presentation should again clearly explain the problem, describe the data, proposal and intermediate results. Each group presentation should last 12 minutes (+3 minutes for questions). Your group will be randomly assigned to present on Tuesday or Thursday, but again you are expected to attend *both* presentation days. It is up to you and your teammates to decide how the presentation will be divided between each member of the team. On top of that, you are expected to pose *at least* two questions to two different groups. Asking questions following teams' presentations will be used to assess class participation.

Note that this midterm review will be an opportunity to assess the progress of your team, so optimize your time to ensure that you have meaningful results by the day of your presentation.

### Milestone 3: Final Project

In the final milestone, you will present your final results.


#### M3 Objectives

In this milestone, you will:

1. Summarize and present your final project.
2. Submit a 4-page (plus references) project report.
3. Final GitHub project page.

#### M3 Deliverables

##### Presentation

Your group should present the final results of your project. The presentation should briefly explain the problem, cover prior work, describe data, proposal, final results, conclusion and future work. Each group presentation should last 12 minutes (+3 minutes for questions). Just like the previous presentations, your group will be randomly assigned to present on Tuesday or Thursday, but you are expected to attend both presentation days. Asking questions following teams' presentations will be used to assess class participation.


##### Report

Your group should also submit a 3-page (plus references) report using the [IEEE VGTC Latex template](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/journal/). The final report should contain the following files: ``01-introduction.tex``, ``02-related.tex``, ``03-data.tex``, ``04-research.tex``, ``05-results.tex``, ``06-conclusion.tex``, and ``proposal.bib`` with the references. You can also add figures inside the ``figs`` repository.

In the ``01-introduction.tex`` file, clearly describe the problem, why it is important, and how you plan to address it.

In the ``02-related.tex`` file, briefly describe prior work, and how the proposal work differs from it.

In the ``03-data.tex`` file, summarize the most important points (e.g., size, attributes) of the dataset you plan to use.

In the ``04-research.tex`` file, discuss how you have tackled the problem. Clearly describe how your project solved (or tried to solve) some of the limitations of related work.

In the ``05-results.tex`` file, detail your results.

In the ``06-conclusion.tex`` file, add a conclusion paying close attention to potential future work discussion.

In this report, you should **clearly** articulate how your work tackled the problem and highlight how your results can point to future research directions. Besides concrete results, it is also important to discuss future work that you were able to identify throughout the semester.

You have three pages to cover **all** of the topics.

##### GitHub page

On top of the presentation and project report, you should also create a well-documented GitHub project page (using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)). The document should include: (1) A high-level description of the problem, why it is important; (2) A summary of the data; (3) Research challenges; (4) Instructions on how to run your code; and (5) Results. For good examples of GitHub project descriptions, see [here](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/urban-pulse), [here](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/city-surfaces), [here](https://github.com/uic-vis/project-3-traffic-crashes-farah-nafiul), or [here](https://github.com/duynguyen2001/Divvy-data-exploration-tool).

### Latex

If this is the first time using LaTeX, go through [this](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials) tutorial. Please note that GitHub is a version control platform, so simply pushing your final proposal document defeats the purpose of using a management system. The GitHub repository should be a good representation of the evolution of all artifacts of the project, including reports, and contributions from individual members of the team. Therefore, if you use Overleaf, you are expected to link your project with your GitHub repository (see [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How_do_I_connect_an_Overleaf_project_with_a_repo_on_GitHub%2C_GitLab_or_BitBucket%3F) for instructions how).

### Evaluation

You will be evaluated based on several key areas: (1) Clarity and relevante of your problem definition, with appropriate scope and significance; (2) Literature review should be comprehensive, analyzing existing research and identifying potential gaps; (3) Methodology will be evaluated based on the appropriateness and implementation of visualization techniques; (4) Data collection and analysis must be thorough, with clear processes and insightful presentation of findings; (5) Visualizations should be clear, informative, with throughtful interpretation connecting back to the research problem; (6) You will also be evaluated on reflections on the project's strengths and weaknesses, lessons learned, and suggestions for future work.

The presentations will be evaluated based on the following criteria: the quality and clarity of your slides, the thoroughness and accuracy of your summary, and the overall engagement and delivery of your presentation. You are encouraged to incorporate live demonstrations in your presentation.
