abstract={A modern city is the combination of several complex and intertwined systems: transportation, street layouts, public utilities and land use all interact with one another in a process that shapes and forms the city, ultimately influencing how people occupy, move and utilize the many services provided by an urban center. The rapid increase in urbanization in the past century has made this process much more complex, as cities struggle to satisfy the demands imposed by an even larger number of people. It is therefore essential to have a better understanding of different aspects of the city, and how they change over time. Fortunately, technological innovations have enabled the automatic collection of a diverse set of data that captures the behavior of different components of a city, such as its residents, existing infrastructure and the environment. This creates new opportunities to better understand different dimensions and facets of the city. By exploring and analyzing urban data through visual analytics systems, domain experts and stakeholders can gain new insights about the data and ultimately the city. However, to be effective, these systems must be interactive, requiring sub-second response times in order to maximize data set coverage during analysis, as well as the rate in which users generate hypotheses. General approaches often fail to drive this interactivity, either because they do not efficiently handle the large size of the data or because they were not designed for a specific task. In this dissertation, we present solutions to enable the interactive exploration of different types of large urban data sets. First, we tackle the challenge of analyzing large temporal data. Advances in technology coupled with the availability of low-cost sensors have resulted in the continuous generation of large time series from several sources. In order to visually explore and compare these time series at different time scales, analysts need to execute online analytical processing (OLAP) queries that include constraints and group-by's at multiple temporal resolutions. To enable interactive OLAP queries over large time series, we propose Time Lattice, a memory-efficient data structure that makes use of the implicit temporal hierarchy; it materializes a subset of a data cube and is designed to handle streaming data. Second, we consider spatiotemporal data. Social media data usually contains not only a temporal (when) and spatial (where) dimensions, but also associated keywords describing what is the data. A popular way to analyze such data is through the ranking of the top objects within a spatial and temporal selection. For example, a popular way to analyze Twitter social media data is to compute the most popular hashtags in a given region (e.g. neighborhood) and time (e.g. summer). For this, we propose TopKube, a rank-aware data cube that enables the computation of such queries interactively by merging pre-computed ranked lists using an hybrid approach that combines a sweep merging algorithm with Fagin's Threshold Algorithm for Top-k queries. Next, we explore the challenges of analyzing 3D data. The rise of collaborative mapping initiatives has created data sets that go beyond the usual flatland spatiotemporal data, capturing also the 3D geometry of the city itself. This creates the perfect opportunity to explore new urban properties at a scale that was not possible before. One of these properties is the impact of shadows from buildings. Shadows can potentially infringe on the "right to light" of other citizens in the community through the occlusion of direct sunlight by shading public spaces. Determining its effects requires the accumulation of shadows over time across different periods in a year. For this, we propose Shadow Accrual Maps, a data structure that uses the properties of sun movement to track the changing position of shadows within a fixed time interval in order to efficiently compute shadow accumulation. Finally, we present the first steps towards visualizing the different views of a city. Using a data set composed of over 40 million street-level images captured by cars in New York City over a period of one year, we create an interactive visualization framework for exploring the various visuals offered by a city. By integrating the images with urban data sets, we allow the interactive exploration of city views under different constraints, such as weather, building construction permits and noise complaints. We demonstrate the utility of our proposals through a number of case studies set in New York City, highlighting its usefulness in the study of common urban problems, such as noise and shadow impact on public spaces.},
