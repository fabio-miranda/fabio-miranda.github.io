	"bio": ["Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I am interested in developing techniques that allow for the interactive analysis of large-scale data, combining methods from visualization, GIS, data management, machine learning, and computer graphics. In particular, I focus on how urban visual analytics can help address different problems cities face by integrating data on different resolutions and from different sources. Some of the urban topics I am interested in include transportation, accessibility, and environmental justice.",
			"I have worked closely with domain experts from different fields, such as architects, urban planners, occupational therapists, transportation specialists, signal processing, and acoustics researchers. The outcome of these collaborations included not only research published in leading venues, but also systems that were made available to experts in academia, industry and government agencies. My work has also received extensive coverage from different media outlets, including The New York Times, The Economist, Architectural Digest, Curbed, Flowing Data, among others.",
			"I received my Ph.D. from NYU in 2018 advised by Prof. Claudio T. Silva. During my Ph.D. studies, I completed internships at Argonne National Lab, IBM Research, AT&T Labs Research, and Sandia National Labs."],
