            "abstract": "While designing sustainable and resilient urban built environment is increasingly promoted around the world, significant data gaps have made research on pressing sustainability issues challenging to carry out. Pavements are known to have strong economic and environmental impacts; however, most cities lack a spatial catalog of their surfaces due to the cost-prohibitive and time-consuming nature of data collection. Recent advancements in computer vision, together with the availability of street-level images, provide new opportunities for cities to extract large-scale built environment data with lower implementation costs and higher accuracy. In this paper, we propose CitySurfaces, an active learning-based framework that leverages computer vision techniques for classifying sidewalk materials using widely available street-level images. We trained the framework on images from New York City and Boston and the evaluation results show a 90.5% mIoU score. Furthermore, we evaluated the framework using images from six different cities, demonstrating that it can be applied to regions with distinct urban fabrics, even outside the domain of the training data. CitySurfaces can provide researchers and city agencies with a low-cost, accurate, and extensible method to collect sidewalk material data which plays a critical role in addressing major sustainability issues, including climate change and surface water management.",

In this study, we adopt a proximity burden metric caused by adjacent hazardous sources, allowing us to evaluate the environmental burden distribution and vulnerability to pollution sources. In close collaboration with a predominantly Latinx community in Chicago, we highlight the usefulness of our approach through a case study that shows how certain community areas in the city are likely to bear a disproportionate burden of environmental pollution caused by industrial roads.",

A proper understanding of the dynamics of commuting flows is, therefore, a requisite to better plan urban areas. In this context, an important task is to study hypothetical scenarios in which possible future changes are evaluated. For instance, how the increase in residential units or transportation modes in a neighborhood will change the commuting flows to or from that region? In this paper, we propose to leverage GMEL, a recently introduced graph neural network model, to evaluate changes in commuting flows taking into account different land use and infrastructure scenarios.

In the absence of an effective vaccine and as cases surge worldwide, governments were forced to adopt measures to inhibit the spread of the disease. To reduce its impact and to guide policy planning and resource allocation, researchers have been developing models to forecast the infectious disease. Ensemble models, by aggregating forecasts from multiple individual models, have been shown to be a useful forecasting method. However, these models can still provide less-than-adequate forecasts at higher spatial resolutions. In this paper, we built COVID-19 EnsembleVis, a web-based interactive visual interface that allows the assessment of the errors of ensembles and individual models by enabling users to effortlessly navigate through and compare the outputs of models considering their space and time dimensions. COVID-19 EnsembleVis enables a more detailed understanding of uncertainty and the range of forecasts generated by individual models.",

            "abstract": "Exploring large virtual environments, such as cities, is a central task in several domains, such as gaming and urban planning. VR systems can greatly help this task by providing an immersive experience; however, a common issue with viewing and navigating a city in the traditional sense is that users can either obtain a local or a global view, but not both at the same time, requiring them to continuously switch between perspectives, losing context and distracting them from their analysis. In this paper, our goal is to allow users to navigate to points of interest without changing perspectives. To accomplish this, we design an intuitive navigation interface that takes advantage of the strong sense of spatial presence provided by VR. We supplement this interface with a perspective that warps the environment, called UrbanRama, based on a cylindrical projection, providing a mix of local and global views. The design of this interface was performed as an interactive process in collaboration with architects and urban planners. We conducted a qualitative and a quantitative pilot user study to evaluate UrbanRama and the results indicate the effectiveness of our system in reducing perspective changes, while ensuring that the warping doesn't affect distance and orientation perception.",

            "abstract": "Predicting commuting flows based on infrastructure and land-use information is critical for urban planning and public policy development. However, it is a challenging task given the complex patterns of commuting flows. Conventional models, such as gravity model, are mainly derived from physics principles and limited by their predictive power in real-world scenarios where many factors need to be considered. Meanwhile, most existing machine learning-based methods ignore the spatial correlations and fail to model the influence of nearby regions. To address these issues, we propose Geo-contextual Multitask Embedding Learner (GMEL), a model that captures the spatial correlations from geographic contextual information for commuting flow prediction. Specifically, we first construct a geo-adjacency network containing the geographic contextual information. Then, an attention mechanism is proposed based on the framework of graph attention network (GAT) to capture the spatial correlations and encode geographic contextual information to embedding space. Two separate GATs are used to model supply and demand characteristics. A multitask learning framework is used to introduce stronger restrictions and enhance the effectiveness of the embedding representation. Finally, a gradient boosting machine is trained based on the learned embeddings to predict commuting flows. We evaluate our model using real-world datasets from New York City and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal against the state of the art.",

            "abstract": "A modern city is the combination of several complex and intertwined systems: transportation, street layouts, public utilities and land use all interact with one another in a process that shapes and forms the city, ultimately influencing how people occupy, move and utilize the many services provided by an urban center. The rapid increase in urbanization in the past century has made this process much more complex, as cities struggle to satisfy the demands imposed by an even larger number of people. It is therefore essential to have a better understanding of different aspects of the city, and how they change over time.\n Fortunately, technological innovations have enabled the automatic collection of a diverse set of data that captures the behavior of different components of a city, such as its residents, existing infrastructure and the environment. This creates new opportunities to better understand different dimensions and facets of the city. By exploring and analyzing urban data through visual analytics systems, domain experts and stakeholders can gain new insights about the data and ultimately the city. However, to be effective, these systems must be interactive, requiring sub-second response times in order to maximize data set coverage during analysis, as well as the rate in which users generate hypotheses. General approaches often fail to drive this interactivity, either because they do not efficiently handle the large size of the data or because they were not designed for a specific task. In this dissertation, we present solutions to enable the interactive exploration of different types of large urban data sets.\n First, we tackle the challenge of analyzing large temporal data. Advances in technology coupled with the availability of low-cost sensors have resulted in the continuous generation of large time series from several sources. In order to visually explore and compare these time series at different time scales, analysts need to execute online analytical processing (OLAP) queries that include constraints and group-by's at multiple temporal resolutions. To enable interactive OLAP queries over large time series, we propose Time Lattice, a memory-efficient data structure that makes use of the implicit temporal hierarchy; it materializes a subset of a data cube and is designed to handle streaming data.\n Second, we consider spatiotemporal data. Social media data usually contains not only a temporal (when) and spatial (where) dimensions, but also associated keywords describing what is the data. A popular way to analyze such data is through the ranking of the top objects within a spatial and temporal selection. For example, a popular way to analyze Twitter social media data is to compute the most popular hashtags in a given region (e.g. neighborhood) and time (e.g. summer). For this, we propose TopKube, a rank-aware data cube that enables the computation of such queries interactively by merging pre-computed ranked lists using an hybrid approach that combines a sweep merging algorithm with Fagin's Threshold Algorithm for Top-k queries.\n Next, we explore the challenges of analyzing 3D data. The rise of collaborative mapping initiatives has created data sets that go beyond the usual flatland spatiotemporal data, capturing also the 3D geometry of the city itself. This creates the perfect opportunity to explore new urban properties at a scale that was not possible before. One of these properties is the impact of shadows from buildings. Shadows can potentially infringe on the 'right to light' of other citizens in the community through the occlusion of direct sunlight by shading public spaces. Determining its effects requires the accumulation of shadows over time across different periods in a year. For this, we propose Shadow Accrual Maps, a data structure that uses the properties of sun movement to track the changing position of shadows within a fixed time interval in order to efficiently compute shadow accumulation.\n Finally, we present the first steps towards visualizing the different views of a city. Using a data set composed of over 40 million street-level images captured by cars in New York City over a period of one year, we create an interactive visualization framework for exploring the various visuals offered by a city. By integrating the images with urban data sets, we allow the interactive exploration of city views under different constraints, such as weather, building construction permits and noise complaints.\n We demonstrate the utility of our proposals through a number of case studies set in New York City, highlighting its usefulness in the study of common urban problems, such as noise and shadow impact on public spaces.",

They can be both beneficial, such as for pedestrians during summer, and detrimental, by impacting vegetation and by blocking direct sunlight. Determining the effects of shadows requires the accumulation of shadows over time across different periods in a year. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient class of approach that uses the properties of sun movement to track the changing position of shadows within a fixed time interval. We use this approach to extend two commonly used shadowing techniques, shadow maps and ray tracing, and demonstrate the efficiency of our approach. Our technique is used to develop an interactive visual analysis system, Shadow Profiler, targeted at city planners and architects that allows them to test the impact of shadows for different development scenarios. We validate the usefulness of this system through case studies set in Manhattan, a dense borough of New York City.",

            "abstract": "Advances in technology coupled with the availability of low-cost sensors have resulted in the continuous generation of large time series from several sources. In order to visually explore and compare these time series at different scales, analysts need to execute online analytical processing (OLAP) queries that include constraints and group-by's at multiple temporal hierarchies. Effective visual analysis requires these queries to be interactive. However, while existing OLAP cube-based structures can support interactive query rates, the exponential memory requirement to materialize the data cube is often unsuitable for large data sets. Moreover, none of the recent space-efficient cube data structures allow for updates. Thus, the cube must be re-computed whenever there is new data, making them impractical in a streaming scenario. We propose Time Lattice, a memory-efficient data structure that makes use of the implicit temporal hierarchy to enable interactive OLAP queries over large time series. Time Lattice is a subset of a fully materialized cube and is designed to handle fast updates and streaming data. We perform an experimental evaluation which shows that the space efficiency of the data structure does not hamper its performance when compared to the state of the art. In collaboration with signal processing and acoustics research scientists, we use the Time Lattice data structure to design the Noise Profiler, a web-based visualization framework that supports the analysis of noise from cities. We demonstrate the utility of Noise Profiler through a set of case studies.",

            "abstract": "The recent explosion in the number and size of spatio-temporal data sets from urban environments and social sensors creates new opportunities for data-driven approaches to understand and improve cities. Visual analytics systems like Urbane aim to  empower domain experts to explore multiple data sets, at different time and space resolutions. Since these systems rely on computationally-intensive spatial aggregation queries that slice and summarize the data over different regions, an important challenge is how to attain interactivity. While traditional pre-aggregation approaches support interactive exploration, they are unsuitable in this setting because they do not support ad-hoc query constraints or polygons of arbitrary shapes. To address this limitation, we have recently proposed Raster Join, an approach that converts a spatial aggregation query into a set of drawing operations on a canvas and leverages the rendering pipeline of the graphics hardware (GPU). By doing so, Raster Join evaluates queries on the fly at interactive speeds on commodity laptops and desktops.  In this demonstration, we showcase the efficiency of Raster Join by integrating it with Urbane and enabling interactivity. Demo visitors will interact with Urbane to filter and visualize several urban data sets over multiple resolutions.",

			"abstract": "Cities are inherently dynamic. Interesting patterns of behavior typically manifest at several key areas of a city over multiple temporal resolutions. Studying these patterns can greatly help a variety of experts ranging from city planners and architects to human behavioral experts. Recent technological innovations have enabled the collection of enormous amounts of data that can help in these studies. However, techniques using these data sets typically focus on understanding the data in the context of the city, thus failing to capture the dynamic aspects of the city. The goal of this work is to instead understand the city in the context of multiple urban data sets. To do so, we define the concept of an 'urban pulse' which captures the spatio-temporal activity in a city across multiple temporal resolutions. The prominent pulses in a city are obtained using the topology of the data sets, and are characterized as a set of beats. The beats are then used to analyze and compare different pulses. We also design a visual exploration framework that allows users to explore the pulses within and across multiple cities under different conditions. Finally, we present three case studies carried out by experts from two different domains that demonstrate the utility of our framework.",

Hexahedral cells, when compared to tetrahedral ones, tend to be more numerically stable and to require less mesh refinement.

A set of computational experiments demonstrates that our proposal produces accurate results, with reduced memory footprint.
