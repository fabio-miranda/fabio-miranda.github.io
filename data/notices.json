While my work spans a broad range of data science areas (e.g., machine learning, data management), my primary focus lies in visualization and visual analytics. If you are interested, please review my most recent publications and reach out with a description of your skills, interests, and how they align with my current research. Note that I may not be able to respond to all emails from prospective students."
