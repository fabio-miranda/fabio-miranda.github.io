### Research Areas

The analysis of large and complex data is usually an exploratory process in which domain expertise plays a significant role. It is, therefore, essential to integrate the user into the analysis loop, enabling them to formulate hypotheses and gain new insights into domain-specific problems. Interactive visualization is central in the support of this process. My research focuses on proposing new methods and systems that allow for the interactive visual analysis of large data sets, combining **visualization**, **hci**, **computer graphics**, **data management**, and **machine learning** in order to tackle fundamental challenges in data science, enable effective analysis of large data and untangle real-world problems. I am particularly interested in making contributions that can help address different problems cities face by integrating data on different resolutions and from different sources. 

On this page you will find information about my research, the city of Chicago, the University of Illinois at Chicago, and open positions.

The figure above highlights some of the papers I have published over the past few years, contributing new techniques, methods and tools for the analysis of large data:  
**(a)** Fast accumulation of shadows to compute the shadow impact on public spaces from new proposed buildings and an alternate scenario (highlighted in purple) in Manhattan (NYC) ([paper](https://fmiranda.me/publications/shadow-accrual-maps/)).  
**(b)** Comparison of locations across NYC and San Francisco using computational topology. *Pulses* are computed using a collection of time-varying scalar functions over different temporal resolutions ([paper](https://fmiranda.me/publications/urban-pulse/)).  
**(c)** Using convolutional neural network features to assess the condition of curb cuts before and after snowfall in regions having a higher concentration of older adults ([paper](https://fmiranda.me/publications/urban-mosaic/)).  
**(d)** A graph neural network to model commuting flows between census tracts in NYC, considering geographic contextual information and urban indicators ([paper](https://fmiranda.me/publications/gmel/)).

### Themes
Below I highlight some of my current interests. Note that a paper (or research project) can fall under multiple themes, as it makes use of (or contributes to) multiple fields in computer science. Also, note that this is a non-exhaustive list, and the main goal is to give a general idea of my work and research.

#### Visual data analysis

<img style="padding-left: 10px; float: right" src="../publications/raster-join-demo/raster-join-demo-teaser.png" alt="Urbane" title="Urbane" width="30%">

Effective analysis and exploration of data require feedback loops and close collaboration with domain experts and stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations. Well-designed visualizations and interactions enable users to gain actionable insights into problems by formulating and testing hypotheses, and address domain specific challenges. In my research I am interested in: proposing new visual representations, data mining techniques, and query models that enable easy and effective exploration of large data. 

##### Example of papers
* *Shadow Accrual Maps: Efficient Accumulation of City-Scale Shadows over Time*, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics ([link](https://fmiranda.me/publications/shadow-accrual-maps/))
* *Time Lattice: A Data Structure for the Interactive Visual Analysis of Large Time Series*, Computer Graphics Forum ([link](https://fmiranda.me/papers/time-lattice/))
* *Interactive Visual Exploration of Spatio-Temporal Urban Data Sets using Urbane*, SIGMOD 2018 Best Demo ([link](https://fmiranda.me/publications/raster-join-demo/))
* *Urban Pulse: Capturing the Rhythm of Cities*, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics ([paper](https://fmiranda.me/publications/urban-pulse/))

##### Current projects
* Visualization of probability distributions of geographical data.
* Interactive profiling of city land use evolution.
* Visual data exploration through user-steerable projections.

#### 3D Analytics

<img style="padding-left: 10px; float: right" src="../publications/shadow-accrual-maps/shadow-accrual-maps-teaser.png" alt="Shadow Accrual Maps" title="Shadow Accrual Maps" width="30%">

The rise of new sensing initiatives has created data sets that go beyond the usual flatland spatiotemporal data, capturing a new perspective of the city at an unprecedented scale. Examples of such initiatives are aerial surveys and collaborative mapping. The interactive analysis of such data creates the perfect opportunity to explore new urban features at a scale that was not possible before. In my research I make use of these novel data sets to propose new techniques and systems to virtually explore cities as well as analyze important problems facing cities today, such as shadow impact and accessibility.

* *Shadow Accrual Maps: Efficient Accumulation of City-Scale Shadows over Time*, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics ([link](https://fmiranda.me/publications/shadow-accrual-maps/))
* *Interactive Visual Exploration of Spatio-Temporal Urban Data Sets using Urbane*, SIGMOD 2018 Best Demo ([link](https://fmiranda.me/publications/raster-join-demo/))


##### Current projects
* Urban navigation in virtual reality.

#### Data structures and indices

<img style="padding-left: 10px; float: right" src="../publications/topkube/topkube-teaser.png" alt="Topkube" title="Topkube" width="30%">

In order to be most effective, visual analytics systems must be interactive, requiring sub-second response times. General approaches often fail to drive this interactivity, as the scale of the data presents several challenges. In my research, I propose data structures and indices to enable the interactive visual analysis of various large data sets.

##### Example of papers
* *Time Lattice: A Data Structure for the Interactive Visual Analysis of Large Time Series*, Computer Graphics Forum ([link](https://fmiranda.me/publications/time-lattice/))
* *Interactive Visual Exploration of Spatio-Temporal Urban Data Sets using Urbane*, SIGMOD 2018 Best Demo ([link](https://fmiranda.me/publications/raster-join-demo/))
* *TopKube: A Rank-Aware Data Cube for Real-Time Exploration of Spatiotemporal Datasets*, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics ([link](https://fmiranda.me/publications/topkube/))

##### Current projects
* Interactive exploration of large image databases.
* Interactive visual analysis with learned structures.

#### Machine learning

<img style="padding-left: 10px; float: right" src="../publications/urban-mosaic/urban-mosaic-teaser.png" alt="Urban Mosaic" title="Urban Mosaic" width="30%">

New sources of data have enabled us to quantify the urban environment at unprecedented scale and detail, allowing us to tackle new questions in urban science. It is increasingly necessary to investigate and propose new machine learning techniques that are able to 1) extract meaningful data from this urban data exhaust, and 2) model important urban phenomena.

##### Example of papers
* *Urban Mosaic: Visual Exploration of Streetscapes Using Large-Scale Image Data*, CHI 2020 ([link](https://fmiranda.me/publications/urban-mosaic/))
* *Learning Geo-Contextual Embeddings for Commuting Flow Prediction*, AAAI 2020 ([link](https://fmiranda.me/publications/gmel/))

##### Current works
* Commuting trip distribution modeling using graph neural network.
* Automatic assessment of built environment from street-level images.
